# WinTXT
WinTXT -- A Command Line Text Editor For Windows

# 1: Introduction

WinTXT is a command-line utility for writing/editing text documents written in batch script. It's fairly bare-bones, but it gets the job done if you need/want a command line text editor for windoes.
WinTXT began when I was inspired by a video of a Batch OS text editor and thought (I can make that!) And so I did.
Because it's so basic, it's pretty easy to use.

# 2: How to use.

With WinTXT, to edit a text file, simply go to the command line, navigate to where you have Wintext.bat stored, then type "wintext" followed by the path to the text document you want to edit, for just open WinTXT in explorer and use the built in menu.

When you get in, to use commands you type these at the "Type" Prompt:
/exit : Exit the program
/undo : Undo the last thing you typed in
/help : View the help page.
/redo : Redo the last thing you un-did
/del : Delete the document you're working on (You can undo this with /undo)
/linebreak : Insert a linebreak

# 3: Limitations

This text editor has no creature comforts. Moving up in the text to edit things from before? Forget about it. Fancy formatting? Nada.
You just type in text line by line. However, as people more talented then me join and contribute to WinTXT, hopefully some of these things will be added in.

# 4: Conclusion

This text editor is great if you have 4KB left on your disk. Otherwise, as of now it's a bottlenecked to the point of near uselessness text editor made in 1 day by someone who isn't great at batch scripts.

# 5: What to look forward to:

Though as of now this program is very limited, editing past lines is in the designing phase (aka figuring out how to implement this), and features are being added my me every so often.
